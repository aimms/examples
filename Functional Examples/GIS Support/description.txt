This AIMMS project illustrates how to display map data obtained from a Geographical Information System (GIS) in AIMMS.
 
AIMMS supports various types of GIS sources:

- OGC Web Map Service (WMS)
- OGC Web Feature Service (WFS)
- Microsoft Bing Maps
- OpenStreetMap
- locally stored ESRI shape files, the format as used by ArcGIS and ArcView
- locally stored feature data stored in OGC Geography Markup Language (GML) format
- locally stored map image files
 
In AIMMS, the display of GIS are available as part of the page network object. A GIS map can be displayed as a (dynamic) background image of a network. In this example, three demo pages are available. 

Demo page 1: A GIS map obtained from two WMS sources. Arcs and Nodes are drawn on top of the GIS background image. The arcs are drawn based on the result of optimizing a simple transport model. Some selection objects are created to allow users to hide/display some GIS layers.

Demo page 2: illustrates how the network object serves as a map viewer object (i.e. a network object without any nodes and arcs being specified). The GIS data is imported from a WMS source as well as from several local GML files and ESRI files. The second demo page also illustrates the possibility to control the layer color (for the GML layers) from within your AIMMS model.

Demo page 3: illustrates how AIMMS is able to use maps provided by OpenStreetMap.
