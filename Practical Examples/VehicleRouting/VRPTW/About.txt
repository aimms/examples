Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows

Problem type:
MIP (medium)

Keywords:
Incumbent callback, network object

Description:
The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) deals with the distribution
of goods between depots and customers using vehicles. The vehicles have a limited
capacity. Each customer has to be supplied within the time window associated with
the customer.

The model formulation follows Desrochers et al. (1988), pp. 67-68.

By default this project uses the data instance 'R106.25' from the Solomon set at:

More instances are available as cases.
