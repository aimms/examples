Finding multiple solutions for the dice problem

Problem type:
MIP (small)

Keywords:
Multiple solutions, Incumbent callback, Solution pool, GMP

Description:
This example demonstrates several approaches to get multiple solutions when
solving a MIP problem. These approaches are:
- Using the incumbent (solver) callback;
- Using the solution pool (only supported by CPLEX);
- Repeatedly solve the problem forbidding the previous solutions.

In the dice problem a set of three dice has to be designed by assigning an
integer number to each face such that on average dice 1 beats dice 2, dice
2 beats dice 3 and dice 3 beats dice 1. The goal is to maximize the number
of total wins on average. The dice problem has many solutions.
