Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem

Problem type:
MIP (medium)

Keywords:
Subtour elimination, Miller-Tucker-Zemlin, incumbent callback, network object

Description:
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) deals with the distribution of goods between depots
and customers using vehicles. In the Capacitated VRP the vehicles have a limited
capacity. The model formulation in this project uses the three-index vehicle flow
model of Toth and Vigo (2002), denoted by VRP4 on pp. 15-16. In this project two
variants on this formulation are used. In the first variant the constraint (1.33) is
replaced by the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin constraints (1.37) and (1.38). In the second
variant it is replaced by the subtour elimination constraints (1.36).

This project uses the data instance 'E-n23-k3' from the Christofides and Eilon
set at http://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/
